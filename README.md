# Machine-Learning
## Overview
This repository contains a collection of hands-on Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the foundations of machine learning using Python and the scikit-learn library. It is designed for learners who want to understand how to apply ML techniques on real-world datasets.

## Included Topics

**1. Supervised Learning**

**Classification:**

Predicting label(e.g., mnist)

-Logistic Regression

-Decision Trees

-Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Regression:**

Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices)

-Linear Regression

-Regularization methods (Ridge, Lasso)

**2. Ensemble Methods**
   
Combining multiple models to improve performance:

-Bagging (e.g., Random Forest)

-Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost)

-Bias-variance trade-off and model stability

**3. Model Evaluation & Tuning**

-Cross-validation

-Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

-Confusion matrix

-ROC-AUC curve

-Grid search for hyperparameter tuning

**4. Data Preprocessing & Pipelines**

-Handling missing values

-Feature scaling (Standardization, Normalization)

-Encoding categorical variables

-Full ML pipeline construction using Pipeline and ColumnTransformer

**5. Working with Popular Datasets**

-MNIST (handwritten digit recognition)

-Iris (flower classification)

-California Housing dataset (price prediction) etc.
